Here's a list of the good, the bad, and the ugly. 

- Wordpress -> GitHub export works. 
- Github -> WordPress doesn't work. 
  - Response "/ is an invalid repository" with `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` for webhook:
      1. Set webhook response to `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`
      2. Edit a file and commit. 
      3. View webhook response: as mentioned above.
